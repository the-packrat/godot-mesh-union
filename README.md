Have multiple MeshInstance3Ds you would love to join into one mesh? This plugin will do that, and preserve the material from each surface of each mesh.
It's dead simple to use, just select the MeshInstance3Ds you want to join together, click the "Join!" button and boom, a new MeshInstance3D with an ArrayMesh containing all the surfaces found.
Comes with a few quality-of-life features such as options to automatically select the new created mesh, and/or unselect all else on creation.
It's not flashy, but it was made to deal with a specific problem in the most streamlined fashion possible. :)
